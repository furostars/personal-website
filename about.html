      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-link">https://furostars.github.io/personal-website/about.html</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Hi! My name is Florence as you might guess from the home page. I created this CV website in order to mimic Google's
      search engine :) I was looking to create a personal website for myself when I came across a blogpost regarding a Amazon look-alike CV page - this was create by Philippe Dubost which you can check it out here: https://phildub.com/
      This website was created from scratch and it took a really long time to complete but I am quite impress with my work if I do say so myself haha :D </p>

      <h3>Advertising</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-link">https://furostars.github.io/personal-website/about.html</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ever since I was introduced to the Cloud world since October, I have taken a huge interest in it and wish to continue staying in this field for the forseeable future - be it in Tech consultancies, Engineering, or perhaps even Cloud sales. 
        Having acquired the Solutions Architect Associate Certification, I've also realised the importance of Cloud infrastructure as well as the complexity of it. This also sparks an interest in me of working as a Solutions Architect in the future as I would like to 
        contribute to building a well designed cloud architecture for the company I am working for. 
      </p>
