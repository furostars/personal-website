          LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM<br></b>
        <br>
        <br>
      

        <b>SOFTWARE ENGINEER INTERN JAN - APR 2018<br>
          ATMARK SOLUTIONS INC., OSAKA, JAPAN</b><br>
        Motivated & Adaptable: Despite being an Economics major, I
        decided to do something I was always interested in but new to me,
        and applied for this internship which forced me to learn how to
        code in HTML, CSS, Java and some Python. As a result, I managed
        to design an English version of the company’s front page and
        embarked on mini projects on my own too.<br>

        <br>
        <b>CREW MEMBER 2017 - 2018<br>
          LAWSON INC., SAITAMA, JAPAN</b><br>
        Team-player & Interpersonal skills: Increased the number of sales
        in hot food as a result of careful planning as well as bringing in
        more foreign customers to the store. Also improved the work
        atmosphere between foreign workers and local workers by facilitating them with my language skills.<br>
        <br>

        <b>LOGISTICS INTERN MAR - JUN 2017<br>
          YAMATO TRANSPORT CO., LTD, TOKYO, JAPAN<br></b>
        Problem-solver: Contributed to the improvement of the transportation problem that Yamato was facing by brainstorming ideas
        with my fellow interns on how to cope with the shortage of drivers,
        and the increasing demand for home deliveries as a result of the
        internet shopping boom.<br>
        <br>

        <b>PRIVATE ENGLISH TUTOR 2016 - 2017<br>
          HELLO SENSEI (Self-Employed), TOKYO, JAPAN</b><br>
        Self-starter & Well-organised: Independently looked for my own
        students as a self-employed teacher. This allowed me to set my
        own teaching prices as well as improved my own organisation and
        self-confidence.<br>
        <br>

        <b>STUDENT STAFF 2015 - 2017<br>
          TOKYO INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY, JAPAN</b><br>
        Leadership & Culturally sensitive: Worked for the ‘Campus-Globalisation’ Team and organised my school’s events/festivals as well as
        increased the number of international students participating in
        Japanese events by oering translation and guide.<br>

        Self-initiative & Leadership: Cooperated with one of my
        University’s teacher to organise a dog walking event to help a
        dog shelter in Tokyo every 3 months. As a result of well-planning, advertising, and word of mouth, I managed to gather a
        group of about 15 people to attend it on a regular basis.
        <br>
